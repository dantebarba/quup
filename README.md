## AI App Comparison

Quup is a small competition to compare AI models by having them build the **same app** from the **same requirements**.

---

## Rules

* App requirements are in **`PROMPT.md`**
* The solution **must be a working app**
* Use **one initial prompt** + **up to 5 yes/no clarifications**
* No manual edits — commit **raw AI output only**

---

## Submission

* Submit via **Pull Request** to https://github.com/dantebarba/quup
* Create a branch named **after the model used**

```
gpt-4.1
claude-3.5
gpt-5
```

* The PR author identifies you

---

## What to include

Your branch must contain:

* The generated app (any language / framework)
* A `README.md` with:

  * Model name
  * Yes/no clarification log (if any)
  * Run instructions (as generated by the AI)

**Same prompt. Same rules. Different models.** 👾
